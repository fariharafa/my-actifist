        <h2>Human Trafficking</h2>
        <li>A common trend of human trafficking is that young women were offered jobs like modeling, dancing or to be a nanny of a wealthy family with good pay.+</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>They often received these false promises through talking to men online </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>The main targets are usually young, pretty, and vulnerable women</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>According to “Psychology Today”, about 200,000 women are annually forced into sex trade in US</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>The Super Bowl is the largest human trafficking event in the US. The party atmosphere and huge crowds make it easier for victims to go unnoticed </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Children are often victims in human trafficking</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>The FBI rescued more than 80 children and 120 traffickers in Operation Cross Country XL, with half of the arrests in Georgia </li>

        <h2>Immigration</h2>
        <li>There are approximately 43.3 million immigrants that live in the US</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Problems adjusting their status → Many unauthorized immigrants qualify for a green card by having a close relative who is a citizen in the US. However, they are not able to change their status from within the US because they haven’t been admitted to the country. So if they leave the US to get a immigrant visa then re-entry would be more difficult and the process would take longer.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>In 2016, immigrants contributed about $2 trillion to the US GDP (Gross Domestic Product). This shows that majority of the workforce within the US is made by immigrants.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Unauthorized immigrants (children included) are not appointed legal counsels in deportation proceedings, meaning they are not given a fair trial.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Zero tolerance immigration policy → A policy that allows immigration authorities/officers to detain immigrants and children. This cause children to be placed in different facilities from their families </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>The director of US Citizenship and Immigration Service (U.S.C.I.S), Lee Cissna has made changes to the agency that mirrors Trump’s administration hard-stance on immigration. The agency has increased difficulty for work visas that many companies in the US want to hire. All the changes within the U.S.C.I.S regarding the asylum process often discourages people from coming or seeking refuge in the US.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Immigration policy changes → One change that Trump’s administration is they ended protected status for 86,000 Hondurans that live in the US legally since early 2000s. Now they have 18 months to leave the US or they may be deported.</li>

        <li>America’s population is aging- causing a problem on social welfare (social security)</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Poverty today looks different than the past. People living in poverty today may still own computers, cars, phones, and cable TV. Because of this, other people may not consider that situation to be "true" poverty.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>More people owe more than they own</li>

          <p></p>
          <li>The day after the San Bernardino incident on Dec. 2, 2015, the Senate rejected a bill that was set to make background check requirements for guns stricter. This same thing happened in 2013'; after rejecting a bill for background checks, a gunman killed six adults and 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School.</li>
